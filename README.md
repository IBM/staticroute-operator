# staticroute-operator
Static IP route operator for Kubernetes clusters

# Prerequisites
The following components are needed to be installed on your environment:
  * git
  * go 1.13+
  * docker
  * kubectl v1.12.0 or newer
  * golangci-lint v1.23.6
  * Operator SDK CLI (more information: https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user/install-operator-sdk.md)
  * and access to a Kubernetes cluster on a version v1.12.0 or newer
  * before you run any of the make target below, make sure the following are done:
    - export `REGISTRY_REPO` environment variable to your docker registry repo url (ie.: quay.io/example/staticroute-operator:v0.0.1)
    - export `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the path of kubeconfig file (if not set, default $$HOME/.kube/config will be used)
    - login to your docker registry using your credentials (ie.: docker login... , ibmcloud cr login etc.)

# Customizations
 * Routing table: By default static route controller uses #254 table to configure static routes. The table number is configurable by giving a valid number between 0 and 254 as `TARGET_TABLE` environment variable. Changing the target table on a running operator is not supported. You have to properly terminate all the existing static routes by deleting the custom resources before restarting the operator with the new config.
 * Protect subnets: Static route operator allows to set any subnet as routing destination. In some cases users can break the entire network by mistake. To protect some of the subnets you can use a comma separated list in `PROTECTED_SUBNETS` environment variable. The operator will ignore custom route if the subnets (in the custom resource and the protected list) are overlapping each other.

# Updating the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
Make sure, that every time you modify anything in `*_types.go` file, run the `make update-operator-resource` to update generated code for `k8s` and `CRDs`.

# Building the static route operator
`make dev-publish-image` target can be used for updating, building and publishing the operator image into your Docker repository

# Testing the changes
Once you have made changes in the source, you have two option to run and test your operator:
- as a `deployment` inside a Kubernetes cluster
- as a binary program running locally on your development environment
  1. Run as a deployment inside your cluster
     - run the `make dev-run-operator-remote` target which updates your operator resources, builds the operator, pushes the built operator docker image to the `REGISTRY_REPO`, changes the operator manifest file and creates the Kubernetes resources (CRDs, operator, role, rolebinding and service account) inside the cluster
     - you can remove the operator resources using `make dev-cleanup-operator` target
  2. Run as a Go program on your local development environment
     - run `make dev-run-operator-local`

# Setting Travis-CI [WIP]
If you want to test, build and publish your changes into your own personal repo after forking this project, you need to following variables set up in Travis instance associated to your github project:
  - DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME, this is the name of your docker image ie. myrepo/staticroute-operator
  - DOCKER_REGISTRY_LIST, you need at least one docker repository url to publish docker images. This is a comma separated list of repo urls.
  - DOCKER_USERNAME, username for your docker repository
  - GH_REPO, your github repo with the project name, ie: github.com/myrepo/staticroute-operator
  - GH_TOKEN, github token generated to access (tag, and push) to your github repository
  - and a set of variables that contains the docker password for each repository url ie. if you set `my.docker.repo.io,quay.io` in DOCKER_REGISTRY_LIST than you need a `my_docker_repo_io` and `quay_io` secrets with the corresponding passwords
  (Note: you should take care of GH_TOKEN and docker passwords to be non-visible secrets in Travis!)
